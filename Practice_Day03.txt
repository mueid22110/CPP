Problem:
Chef and Instant Noodles
Chef has invented 1-minute Instant Noodles. As the name suggests, each packet takes exactly 1 minute to cook.

Chef's restaurant has X stoves and only 1 packet can be cooked in a single stove at any minute.

How many customers can Chef serve in Y minutes if each customer orders exactly 1 packet of noodles?

Input Format
The first and only line of input contains two space-separated integers X and Y — the number of stoves and the number of minutes, respectively.
Output Format
Print a single integer, the maximum number of customers Chef can serve in Y minutes
Constraints

1≤X,Y≤1000


solve:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int X, Y;
	cin >> X >>Y;
	
	cout << X*Y;

}

Problem:
In the new CodeChef Learn module, under the "Learn Problem Solving" section, there are two courses for each language. For eg. "Python Beginner - Part 1" and "Python Beginner - Part 2". These courses help you get started with CodeChef contests.

Currently there are courses for 4 languages, and hence there are 8 courses in this section. But suppose there are courses for N languages, what will be the total number of courses in this section?

Input Format
The only line of input will contain a single integer N, denoting the number of languages for which there are courses.

Output Format
Output on a single line the total number of courses in the section.

Constraints
1≤N≤100

solve:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int N;
	cin >> N;
	cout << 2*N;

}
